# Anthony Ferraioli - Project 1 Proposal
# *Chubby Rocket*
## I. High Concept
Chubby Rocket is a 2D game where you control a rocket flying through space. It is similar to other mobile or website games in that
it is an endless survival game, so the objective is to last as long as you can and gain a new high score. There will be asteroids and other 
obstacles to avoid, and the longer you survive the more challenging and aggressive the obstacles become.

## II. Genre
Casual, Action, Arcade

---

## III. Platform
This game will be primarily accessible by only users on a computer. However, given enough time to polish the game, it could become
accessible for all different platforms, including mobile and tablet users.

---

## IV. Story
You are an astronaut in the world's chubbiest rocket ship, exploring the vast space. As you explore you start to enter uncharted 
territory, possible due to the high amounts of asteroids found within. You brave the storm and travel into the unknown, hoping to find
something remarkable at the other end. As you explore, and the asteroid field gets more and more clustered you start to wonder... is there
even an end to this place, or are you stuck in an endless void doomed to forever listen to the same 8-bit song on repeat? How far can you
go before you become just another careless whisper in space?

## V. Esthetics
The game will be primarily cartoony, with realistic looking asteroids and 3D models for everything. 
The background will have a multi-layered parallax effect, one layer for stars, one for distant planets, and one for the space itself.
There will be one specific background song, 8-bit careless whisper. There will be other sound effects such as an explosion for when you
crash into an asteroid, a sound for lasers being shot, a sound for aliens that will appear, etc.

## VI. Gameplay

### *Mechanics*
The player will have to maneuver around obstacles in order to not get hit by any incoming asteroids. The player will also have the
ability to shoot a laser once the laser is fully charged, which will remove all asteroids in front of the player.

### *Controls*
The player will move around the chubby rocket using WASD or arrow controls. The player will also be able to fire a laser by hitting the
space bar.
*If this game becomes accessible for mobile users* There will be an option to change controls. This will give the ability to control
with the mouse and shoot with the left click, or move by touching the screen and shoot by clicking twice on the screen fast with your
finger.

### *Teaching the player*
There will be a menu screen, where you can access a "How To Play" screen detailing the controls. The game will also always start out
with little-to-know challenge, so a newcoming can easily figure out the controls before the waves of obstacles start coming.

### *Player Learning*
The player will have to learn some strategies in order to overcome this game and recieve a high score of impressive magnitude. One
strategy the player will have to learn is not always fire the laser when it's fully charged, but rather wait until they desperately need
it. Also, it is a good practice to hang below incoming asteroids until there is a clear escape route to take, otherwise you may put
yourself in a more difficult situation to escape from. It will also be good to be able to look both at the player and immediately
incoming obstacles, as well as the top of the screen to anticipate obstacles you will have to overcome.

## VIII. Other Information
Chubby Rocket was a game I created with a friend back in my junior year of high school. It was in its simplest form back then; it was
coded in java and was not well organized at all. My goal this semester was to recreate it in a polished version using Unity, and I
figured this was the prime opportunity to make a website for it. This will allow me to share my game with online users as well as
keep a detailed progress update page so I can see how the game and website evolved as I worked on it.

## IX. About the Developer
My name is Anthony Ferraioli. I am a second year Game Design and Development major and Creative Writing minor at Rochester Institute 
of Technology. I have been coding since my freshman year of highschool, and I have tons of experience using both Java and C#. I started
making games all the way back in middle school, when I used to use this program called Super Mario Bros. X to make my own Mario games.
This is probably why I have grown to have such a love for platformer games, level designing, and storytelling in video games. These are
my main interests in game designing, however I just as much love making silly mobile-like games such as Chubby Rocket.
