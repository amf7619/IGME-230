# Anthony Ferraioli - Project 1 Proposal
# *El Hombre De Reciclaje*
## I. High Concept
In El Hombre De Reciclaje, you play as a superhero whose objective is to clean the world and recycle all recyclable material. When your attempts to clean the world get interrupted by a sociopathic villain named El Criminal, it is up to you to save the city of Gotham from becoming covered in plastic bottles! This game will play similarly to missile command on the atari, however there will only be one position to shoot from and you will have unlimited ammo.

## II. Genre
Action, Arcade, Casual, Shooting

---

## III. Platform
This game will be primarily accessible by only users on a computer. However, given enough time to polish the game, it could become
accessible for all different platforms, including mobile and tablet users.

---

## IV. Story
El Hombre De Reciclaje is a hero of Spanish decent who is infamous for protecting and promoting recycling all around the world. His journey to defend the world of recyclable waste brings him to the outskirts of Gotham City, where he encounters the great El Criminal who's goal is to pollute the globe. Your goal is to stop his plans by recycling as many bottles as possible and keeping the city clean. Will you be able to clean the city of Gotham before El Criminal gets away with his plans?

## V. Esthetics
The game will have cartoony backgrounds with hyper-realistic player elements such as realistic bottles, an actual picture of El Hombre De Reciclaje, and Recycling bin projectiles.
There will be action-packed music in the background with city ambience playing every so often.
There will also be sound effects for shooting the recycling bins, bottles falling, and game over.

## VI. Gameplay
### *Mechanics*
The player will have a reticle to aim at the incoming bottles. Upon clicking with the mouse, a recycling bin will be fired from El Hombre de Reciclaje, who is located at the bottom middle of the screen. Hit the bottles with the recycling bins to gain points. If a recycling bin hits the ground, you will lose health. You have 5 hit points, with hit points slowly coming back the longer you survive.

### *Controls*
The player will use the mouse to aim the reticle. Left click to fire a recycling bin
*If this game becomes accessible for mobile users* There will be an option to change controls. This will give the ability to aim
with the mouse and shoot with the left click, or touch the screen to fire at that location.

### *Teaching the player*
Upon playing the game for the first time, there will be a "How To Play" that will show up. Also the game will start off easy, giving the player time to figure out the controls.

### *Player Learning*
The player will have to learn some strategies in order to overcome this game and recieve a high score of impressive magnitude. One strategy the player will have to learn is to aim slightly below the falling bottles so that the recycling bin and the bottles collide in mid air. Another strategy is to find priority in which bottle to aim for. The more that are falling at once, the harder it will be to aim at them all. Prioritize the ones that fall faster because there is less time to react to them.

## VIII. Other Information
El Hombre De Reciclaje is a game based off of a video I created for a spanish class back in my junior year of high school. One of my favorite things to do is to make silly things such as that spanish video, and then reference them in newer projects years later. It makes me laugh to look at something I did in the past and see how I can use it to create something new.

## IX. About the Developer
My name is Anthony Ferraioli. I am a second year Game Design and Development major and Creative Writing minor at Rochester Institute 
of Technology. I have been coding since my freshman year of highschool, and I have tons of experience using both Java and C#. I started
making games all the way back in middle school, when I used to use this program called Super Mario Bros. X to make my own Mario games.
This is probably why I have grown to have such a love for platformer games, level designing, and storytelling in video games. These are
my main interests in game designing, however I just as much love making silly mobile-like games such as this one.
